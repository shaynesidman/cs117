<li class="q">How much HTML and CSS did you already know before starting this assignment?</li>
<li class="a">
Before this assignment, I had a good foundation in HTML and CSS (although it had been a while since I've used pure CSS due to alternatives like Tailwind). I have been using both HTML and CSS since high school, so I feel like I had a good grasp on many of the basics. However, I have never explored out from much of the core of HTML.
</li>

<li class="q">This assignment requires that you demonstrate at least three HTML features and at least three CSS features that you had not used before. Please list them (more than three is fine):</li>
<li class="a">
HTML Features:
<ul>
<li>HTML Tables</li>
<li>HTML Iframes</li>
<li>HTML Computercode</li>
</ul>
CSS Features:
<ul>
<li>a:visited</li>
<li>tr:nth-child(even)</li>
<li>clamp(min, preferred, max)</li>
</ul>
<!-- you can replace this comment with more text if there's more you'd like to discuss -->
</li>


<li class="q">Explain briefly the difference between a &lt;div> and a &lt;span></li>
<li class="a">
A div element is block level container, meaning that it takes up its full available horizontal space and any following elements must start on a new line. It is typically used to "surround" or contain another HTML element or elements and group them together. A span only takes up as much width as its content and is inline, meaning it doesn't force following elements to a new line.
</li>

<li class="q">What help did you receive from others? (You don't have to
indicate if someone just told you in general about an interesting HTML or CSS feature, or if they gave general
ideas for making your Web page(s) more interesting, but
you must identify any help you received with learning how to write or debug your code.)</li>
<li class="a">
I only used W3Schools.org to discover new features of HTML and find out how to use them.
</li>

<li class="q">Is there anything else we should know about grading your work (e.g. links we need to follow to see more)?</li>
<li class="a">
No
</li>


<li class="q">Did you do any work for <a href="htmlassignment#extracredit">extra credit</a>?</li>
<li class="a">
Yes, I made a small SVG of a house that was most definitely inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright's work.
</li>


<li class="q">(will not be graded) Do you have any questions about learning HTML? Anything you'd like to see covered more carefully in class?:</li>
<li class="a">
I wonder if there are any core HTML features that were not included in the initial versions. Anything that we use all the time that is now a standard?
